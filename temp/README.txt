This folder or it's subfolders will be the location where to temporary video fragments of 
an incoming live-stream will be stored. You should have a look at these folders once you
are actually livestreaming so you can see what it looks like to have framents of your live-
stream and when you do, open the index file using a text editor and see how this file
gets updated constantly on the fly. But only if you want to learn more on how it all 
works. If you don't care about that then you can safely and completely ignore this folder.

Place the released package Video.JS in this folder. Get it from https://github.com/videojs/video.js.

You may also include a more recent version of videojs-http-streaming.js if you wish. It can be found 
in the src folder of this package: in https://github.com/videojs/http-streaming. But none of this
is actually required to get it up and running.
